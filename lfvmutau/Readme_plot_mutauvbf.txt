plot_mutauvbf.py is a plotting script for the root files generated by the AnalyzeMuTauTight series of analyzers. 

Usage: python plot_mutauvbf.py VARIABLE
where VARIABLE is the variable to be plotted
The long string of elif statements optimizes plotting settings for many variables. It is helpful to call plot_mutau.py many times with different variables via a shell script in order to rapidly generate plots.

Important Global Variables:
shape_norm:
	shape_norm = True normalizes all histograms to 1.
	shape_norm = False normalizes all histograms to data.
binwidth: 
	rebins the histograms for plotting aesthetics and clarity
	can be adjusted for different variables
predir:
	directory of histograms that contain only preselection cuts (histograms that lack the "tight" cuts in AnalyzeMuTauTight)

channel:
	vbf or gg
	note that the variable settings have been optimized for the vbf channel

presel:
	True if only preselection cuts are used
	False if vbf or gg cuts are used ("tight" cuts in AnalyzeMuTauTight)

savedir:
	directory of root files with tight cuts for gg or vbf
	directory plots are saved to

QCD Normalization:
The QCD normalization procedure is split up between three functions: make_qcd_norm, get_ss_inc_qcd, and get_w.
make_qcd_norm:
	Returns the final histogram that the antiisolated QCD shape is normalized to. Applies vbf efficiency factor if presel=False. Calls get_ss_inc_qcd.

get_ss_inc_qcd:
	Gets same sign inclusive QCD by subtracting MC from data in the inclusive (preselection) region. The same sign MC for W+jets is buggy, so get_w is clled to get a W_jets MC same sign estimate

get_w:
	Uses W rich high muon Mt region	to estimate the SS W+jets MC yield

Luminosity and Effective Luminosity:
Running setup.sh in lfvmutau generates files containing the luminosity of data and effective luminosity of MC. For plot_mutauvbf the user specifies the location of their lumicalc files and the code reads the luminosities from these files.
